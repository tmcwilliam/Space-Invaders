# What I learned
________________________
- The actual <canvas> HTML element acts much like any other element. 2 native attributes (width & height). Better to specify dimensions on the actual element rather than CSS. Objects inside canvas distort based on css dimension rules on page load (however I used this to my advantage). Default attributes: Fixed size of 300px x 150px, transparent. 
- **Rendering Context** I focused on 2D context (3D is another option used for WebGL and such)
